Adventure

#### *Simon P. Couch*

This repository contains the source code for a recreation of Willie Crowther's "Colossal Cave Adventure" game in Python, implemented for Computer Science 121 at Reed College (Fall 2018). All `.txt` files, as well as the `tokenscanner.py` module were written by Eric Roberts. To play the game in the terminal, after changing your working directory to `~/adventure/`, the command `python3 adventure.py` will start the program.

Happy playing!
